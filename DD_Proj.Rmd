## Shiny App Overview

- The application is written in R and hosted on RStudio's shiny server   
- Source code comprised of two files - ui.R and server.R      
- ui.R includes the user interface definition which includes the slider bar in the app   
- server.R includes the server logic of the web application where regression, calculations and types of output are specified     


## Diamonds Data Set Explained

- Dataset preloaded in R for use by general public
- This dataset contains information about 53,940 round-cut diamonds   
- There are 6 variables that are of numeric structure: carat, depth, table, x, y, z   
- There is 1 variable that has an integer structure: price
- Summary table from R listed below

## Diamond App Overview

- The app allows you to visualize price estimates for various diamond carat sizes   
- The slider bar lets you pick from carat size 0 to 4.  Pull it left or right to vary settings  
- Also limited the y axis to $25,000 so the prediction estimate would be visible on the chart  
- Link to app is - https://

## Code Explained 

- Example of code in server.R is shown below. 
- Code below shows a regression analysis of the diamond dataset
- Also predicted price based on the carat size selected on the slider bar
